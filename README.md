In this repository I've implemented some important edge detection algorithms which are based on computer vision techniques. These algorithms are as follows:

- [Sobel Algorithm](./algorithms/Sobel-Edge-Detector)

- [Prewit Algorithm](./algorithms/Prewit-Edge-Detector)

- [Robert-Cross Algorithm](./algorithms/Robert-Cross-Detector)

- Laplace of Gaussian Algorithm (LoG)
  
  - [Using Seperated Kernels](./algorithms/LoG-Edge-Detector/Seperated-Kernels)
  
  - [Using Convolved Kernels](./algorithms/LoG-Edge-Detector/Convolved-Kernels)

- [Boolean Function Algorithm](./algorithms/Boolean-Function-Edge-Detector)

- [Canny Algorithm](./algorithms/Canny-Edge-Detector)

Actually I implemented these algorithms to complete my research called "A Study of Computer Vision Algorithms to Detect Edges in Grayscale Images" which was a part of "Research and Technical Representation" course in AUT.

My research paper will be uploaded to this repository as soon as possible!
