In this repository I've implemented some important edge detection algorithms which are based on computer vision techniques. These algorithms are as follows:

- [Sobel Algorithm](./algorithms/Sobel-Edge-Detector)

- [Prewit Algorithm](./algorithms/Prewit-Edge-Detector)

- [Robert-Cross Algorithm](./algorithms/Robert-Cross-Detector)

- Laplace of Gaussian Algorithm (LoG)
  
  - [Using Seperated Kernels](./algorithms/LoG-Edge-Detector/Seperated-Kernels)
  
  - [Using Convolved Kernels](./algorithms/LoG-Edge-Detector/Convolved-Kernels)

- [Boolean Function Algorithm](./algorithms/Boolean-Function-Edge-Detector)

- [Canny Algorithm](./algorithms/Canny-Edge-Detector)

Actually, I implemented these algorithms to complete my technical report called "A Study on Edge Detection Algorithms for Grayscale Images" which was done as a part of "Research and Technical Presentation" course at AUT.

My technical report is available in `report.pdf` file.
